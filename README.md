# Library-Management-System
A simple **Library Management System** built using **C#** as a Console App. The project demonstrates foundational concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, such as **classes**, **objects**, **inheritance**, and **encapsulation**. This console-based application allows users to manage library members, borrow and return books, and track book availability.
